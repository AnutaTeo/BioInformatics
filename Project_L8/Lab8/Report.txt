Three bacterial genomes downloaded from NCBI (all between 2–5 Mbp in length) were used for this analysis: 
campylobacter.fasta
e-coli.fasta
streptococcus.fasta

For every IR detected, the program recorded:
- IR length
- IR sequence
- Left and right IR positions (start and end)

Results were automatically exported to a <filename>_inverted_repeats.txt report.

Genome 1 (E. coli)
Total inverted repeats detected: 22225 inverted repeats
IRs were distributed across the entire chromosome, with no strong clustering pattern.
Most repeats were 4 bp, consistent with random occurrence in large genomes.

Genome 2 (Campylobacter)
Total inverted repeats detected: 14738 inverted repeats
Similar to genome 1, short IRs were found frequently, while 6-bp IRs were less common.
Some IRs appeared in pairs separated by 500–2000 bp, indicating possible transposon activity.

Genome 3 (Streptococcus)
Total inverted repeats detected: 9469 inverted repeats
This genome showed several IR clusters, including multiple occurrences of identical 5-bp repeats, which may correspond to insertion sequences

Comparative Analysis
Across all three genomes, the following trends were observed:
- Short IRs (4 bp) were abundant, largely due to chance in large sequences.
- Longer IRs (6 bp) were relatively rare, which increases their significance.
